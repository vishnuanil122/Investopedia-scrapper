Traditionally, the rate was calculated by each bureau after collecting and analyzing rate data submitted by member insurance carriers in each state. Carriers were not required to adhere to these dates, but they could be instructive to companies and consumers. Bureau rate is a somewhat obsolete term; the rate has been replaced by industry-wide loss data published by each state to assist carriers in setting future rates. The rate data continues to be required among a long list of financial reports by each state for regulatory approval."

A property constructed before the CBIA may still be eligible for federal disaster relief and federal flood insurance, but if it is substantially improved or damaged, these benefits will no longer be available."

Compulsory insurance is mandatory for individuals and businesses that want to engage in certain financially risky activities, such as operating an automobile or operating a business with employees. Compulsory insurance is supposed to protect accident victims against the costs of recovering from an accident that someone else, such as another driver or an employer, has caused. Insurance is regulated at the state level, so each state decides what types of insurance will be compulsory and how much coverage policyholders must purchase. Policyholders may purchase higher limits of coverage if they think the compulsory minimums are insufficient."

In insurance, concurrent causation happens when a property experiences a loss from two separatecauses when one has policy coverage, and the other does not.

                "Disability insurance is a type of insurance tha twill provide income in the event a worker is unable to perform their work and earn money due to a disability. There are many types of organizations that provide different types ofdisability insurance. Each organization and disability insurance type have specific rules as to what constitutes a disability and how a person might qualify to receive the disability benefit. Short term disability insurance policies offer a worker a portion of their salary if they are unable to work for a short period- typically three to six months. Long term disability insurance offers a worker a portion of their salary if they are unable to work for a longer period- typically a period of over six months. Both short term and long term disability policies have a period that a person must be disabled for before that individual is able to start receiving disability benefits. That period of time is called an elimination period. If a person becomes disabled, they must wait until the elimination period is over before they start receiving benefits. If they are able to work before the elimination period is over, the person will not receive a benefit. The Social Security Administrationalso provides disability insurance. Employees who've paid the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) tax for a certain amount of time, are eligible to receive the Social Security disability income insurance if they meet the strict requirements of disability under the OASDIprogram."

The guarantee provides investors with an additional level of comfort that the investment will be repaid in the event that the securities issuer would not be able to fulfill the contractual obligation to make timely payments. It also lowers the cost of financing for issuers because the guarantee typically earns the security a higher credit rating and therefore lower interest rates."

Financial quota shares do not require the ceding company to pay a deductible before coverage begins, as the company will always be responsible for a portion of the loss.Companies, including insurers, often treat reinsurance as a form of capital. This is because a reinsurance treaty allows a ceding company to shift a portion of its risk off of its balance sheet and onto the reinsurer's, thus reducing the amount of capital it may have to employ in the case of a claim."

As a result, they (or their parents) deserve to pay lower insurance premiums since they are less likely than teens with poor grades to file a claim with the insurance company. Since teenage drivers face some of the highest insurance premiums due to their lack of driving experience and higher accident and traffic violation risk, a good student discount provides yet another incentive to do well in school: saving money."

                "The Graham-Cassidy bill is a Republican effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA or \"Obamacare\") that would transfer much of the responsibility for structuring, funding and regulatingof healthcare markets to the states. It was proposed by Senators Bill Cassidy (R-La.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) in September 2017, following a number of failed attempts to roll back Obamacare from March to July. Although they planned to vote on the bill during the week of September 25, following an incomplete Congressional Budget Office (CBO) score, the vote did not happen. The decision not to vote on the Graham-Cassidy bill marked the fourth Obamacare repeal bill failure in 2017,"

Grandfathered status applies to group health plans and individual health insurance policies respectively crated or purchased before enactment of the ACA.

Hardship exemptions are a provision in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), signed into law on March 23, 2010. Starting in 2014, most individuals were required to have an acceptable health-coverage level known as minimum essential coverage, or pay a fee (called theindividual shared responsibility payment). In certain cases, people can qualify for exemptions, including hardship exemptions, whereby no penalty is assessed for having no insurance. As of 2019, the penalty for not having health insurance will be eliminated, so the exemptions below apply to the 2015-2018 tax years."

Hazardous activities include scuba diving, BASE jumping, hang gliding, racecar driving, flying a plane, horseback riding, bungee jumping, parasailing, off-roading and more. If one of your hobbies falls under an insurance companys definition of a hazardous activity, you may not be able to get life or disability insurance, or you may have to pay a higher premium because the insurer considers you high risk. Another possibility is that the insurer will issue a policy, but it will exclude the hazardous activities from coverage. This exclusion means that if you become disabled or die while, say, bungee jumping, the policy will not pay, but if you become disabled or die because of a car accident, the policy will pay."

The OASDI is a comprehensive federal benefits program that provides benefits to retirees, disabled people and their survivors. The goal of the program is to partially replace income that is lost due to old age, death of a spouse or qualifying ex-spouse, or disability. Payments to qualifying persons are funded through payroll taxes collected by the government called FICA taxes.The program was ushered in through the Social Security Act, signed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on August 14, 1935, when the U.S. economy was in the depths of the Great Depression."

A policy with split limits might pay $100,000 per person per incident for bodily injury, with a maximum of $300,000 per incident. If one person seeks $250,000 in damages for their injuries, the maximum the split limit policy will pay is $100,000, even if only one person is injured in the accident. The only way the split limit policy will pay the $300,000 maximum is if three different people each have $100,000 in claims."

Surplus lines insurance, unlike regular insurance, can be purchased from an insurer that is not licensed in the insureds state, though the surplus lines insurer will still need to be licensed in the state where it is based.

Because the insurance company agrees to share the risk of loss with the policyholder, it is imperative that the policyholder act in good faith by fully disclosing all information that affects the insurance company's level of risk. Full disclosure allows the insurer to protect itself by charging the policyholder a premium that accurately reflects the level of risk it is undertaking or even refusing to issue a policy if the risk is too high."

The added coverage provided by liability insurance is most useful to individuals who own a lot of assets or very expensive assets and are at significant risk for being sued."

                "A vermin exclusion is a provision of a property insurance policy that states that the policy will not pay benefits to the policyholder for damage caused by pests such as lice, fleas, roaches, bed bugs and rodents. Insurance companies commonly consider pest control to be part of ongoing maintenance, and do not view infestation as a peril to be insured against. Even if a policy does not have a vermin exclusion, the policyholder may find it difficult to prove the damage and loss caused by the vermin, so a policy may not pay out for vermin damage."
